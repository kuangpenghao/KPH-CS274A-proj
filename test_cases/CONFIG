      We noticed that your project threw a Timeout Exception on q2.
      While many things may cause this, it may have been from
      1. being blocked by a firewall. See the troubleshooting section
      of the README for more information.
      2. downloading a model that is too large. Try to select a
      smaller model with less parameters (<100M) and submit again!

      We noticed that your project threw a Timeout Exception on q4.

      improper chat template such that the model keeps generating
      tokens without stopping. Please refer to the README for more
      information on how to properly format your chat template. Remember
      that the chat template is sensitive to spaces and newlines.
